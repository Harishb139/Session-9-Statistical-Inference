As we have to test the proportions lets do one sample proportions test, and assumed we have taken a sample of 210 cars and found 65 cars automatic of all so defining the null hypothesis to 
Ho: p equal to 0.40
Ha: p not equal to 0.40
Our test p value 0.007444 is less than 0.05 we will reject the null hypo, and accept the alternative hypo that says that p is not equal to 0.40


> #one sample prop test
> prop.test(65,210, p=0.40,alternative="two.sided",conf.level=0.95,correct=F)

	1-sample proportions test without continuity correction

data:  65 out of 210, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 7.1627, df = 1, p-value = 0.007444
alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.4
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.2508894 0.3750017
sample estimates:
        p 
0.3095238
